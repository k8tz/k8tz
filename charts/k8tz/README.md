k8tz is a kubernetes admission controller and a CLI tool to inject timezones into Pods and CronJobs[^1].

## TL;DR

```console
helm repo add k8tz https://k8tz.github.io/k8tz/
helm install k8tz k8tz/k8tz --set timezone=Europe/London
```

## Prerequisites
- Helm 2 or later
- Kubernetes 1.16+ or OpenShift 4.X
- Permissions to use `emptyDir` or `hostPath`

## Installation

First, you need to add k8tz helm repository:

```console
helm repo add k8tz https://k8tz.github.io/k8tz/
```

Then, you can install k8tz admission controller:

```console
helm install k8tz k8tz/k8tz
```

If you want to set some values to configure k8tz, you can use `--set`, e.g:

```console
helm upgrade --install k8tz k8tz/k8tz \
    --set timezone=Europe/Amsterdam \
    --set injectionStrategy=hostPath
```

## Optional: Test Installation

You can use helm to test that installation was successful and the admission controller is running using:

```console
helm test k8tz
```

## Upgrade

Upgrading k8tz does not have any effect on running pods, but only on pods created after the upgrade. 
In production environments, it is recommended to use `--atomic` flag to make the upgrade safer.

```console
helm repo update
helm upgrade k8tz k8tz/k8tz --reuse-values --atomic
```

## Uninstall

To uninstall k8tz with Helm use:

```console
helm delete k8tz
```

[^1]: Timezones for CronJobs are available only from kubernetes >=1.24.0-beta.0 with [`CronJobTimeZone`](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/aad71056d33eccf3845b73670106f06a9e74fec6/keps/sig-apps/3140-TimeZone-support-in-CronJob/README.md) feature gate enabled.
